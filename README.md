## About the Challenge
Create 2 components for us using React. You may use any 3rd party packages you like. Styling and Heroku deployment are bonus points.

### Challenge 1: Month Range Selector
Two months are selected and highlighted. Any months in between are highlighted in a different color.

### Challenge 2: AddressForm
When United states is selected, the state field is a dropdown with all of the states. If any other country is selected, the state field is an input field.
